# Mario-Game

## Description

 This was my first game created with a programming language! consists of a game where we have Mario as the protagonist, and your objective is to jump over obstacles generated by CSS animations, in the game we also have a score and buttons for mobile.

## Found challenges

 When creating this project I used the setTimeout and setInterval, methods a lot and at the time I had no idea how they worked, and in order to solve this problem I looked for more information in the W3C documentation, and I did some in-depth research, so that when I needed them I already knew how to use them correctly.

## What did i learn?

 - Use setTimeout and its features.
 - Use setInterval and its features.

I also learned things like:
 - precise time control with setTimeout
 - and when should I choose to use one or the other.
